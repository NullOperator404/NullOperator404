I own and operate a screen printing shop, and I have a background in web development & graphic design. I am currently in the process of building a design lab app for my company website from the ground up, similar to those found on large print sites
such as Custom Ink & Rush Order Tees. I will post code updates in my respository as the project continues. At present the project is roughly 50-60% complete, with the majority of the remaining work mainly data/resource acquisition for image files, vector paths, etc. 

In my Respositories, you can find a "diary" where I discuss issues, solutions, etc with projects I'm working on. I also have various code snippets. 
Project progress can be tracked as well.
