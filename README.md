I own and operate a screen printing shop, and I have a background in web development & graphic design. I am currently in the process of building a design lab app for my company website from the ground up, similar to those found on large print sites
such as Custom Ink & Rush Order Tees. I will post code updates in my respository as the project continues. At present the project is roughly 50-60% complete, with the majority
of the remaining work mainly data/resource acquisition for image files, vector paths, etc. ![design_lab4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121133484/208769083-d7910e4b-a592-4206-9999-1960b63bd561.jpg)

A few screenshots of the project so far. The entire app is created using HTML, CSS, & JS. JSON handles data requests from the server.
